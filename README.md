<b>Ridge</b> is an open source project designed to bring the Iroquois Ridge High School experience into the pockets of the students.

## Goals
What began as an observation — that accessing the services provided by Iroquois Ridge were found as somewhat of a challenge to the students using a mobile device. What if one could gather all the fundamentals and piece them together into a single hub with an awesome layout? Introducing, the Ridge app.

### Fundamental Goals
- The IR blog, announcements, etc.
- About the Ridge
- Teacher contact information

### Future Ideas
- Virtual tour of the campus
- Section specific to new parents
- Section specific to aspiring parents
- Club information (feat. signup and contact)
- Sports information (feat. contact)
